- Monitoring Tools
- Hosting

- Databases
	- If I am to list databases of interest, Ill add some text link that will link each database with a site, or each site with a database. OR, even better: Per project basis, each project will have its database and linked sites. But ideally ill have a total overview of all the sites each database communicates.
