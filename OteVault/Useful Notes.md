ΑΝΑΠΤΥΞΗ AND DEPLOYMENT ENVIRONMENTS
**-SID - UAT - PET**
~~~
-SID (System Integrate Test) is like the alpha that's exclusive to Devs only.
-UAT(User Acceptance Test), is the last stage before software is released. It ensures it meets user expectations by having them interact with the system. It's always a copy of the Live release. 
-PET (Production Evaluation Test) is the Live release. It is the active deployment that users have access towards.
