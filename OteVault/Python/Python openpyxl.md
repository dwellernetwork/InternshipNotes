-enumerate() is basically a for loop where one variable is the counter, and the other is the tuple or the array that stores the values of each cell, or row, or column it loops over. yes it can store entire rows and columns at a time.


"values_only=true" inside of iter_rows() or iter_columns() gives you only the values instead of just the names of the cells in the excel sheet.
