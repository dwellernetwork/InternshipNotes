These two notes are more general stuff about how things are named when it comes to Databases, database design etc. Thing is, it can expand quite a bit and have other stuff like OBM and Siebel connect to it. We dont want that shit to get out of hand

So I am thonking...

We want a general Databases category. 
What will it enlist?
I mean, an Oracle, a MySQL, and a Vertica database, in terms of difference, it isnt major. They have somewhat different queries , and they have a few different capabilities. But , in front of the I.T. engineer, they are all hammers with slightly different shapes and sizes...
There is a general theory of shared SQL. Then there is specific queries to each of these. Then, there is the structural design of databases in general. So i guess, the general theory of databases and the general way to do it SQL will be on the same tier, and then I can have the subcategories of the databases. 
There is not a whole lot of purpose otherwise on separating the databases.
