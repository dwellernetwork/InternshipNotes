### Erythritol

##### General
Commonly used by many. It has 70% of the sweetness of regular sugar. 
It is GI friendly, and is naturally derived from plants. 
Pros:
- No relation to gastric issues
Cons:
- May cause thirst or urination more often
- This stuff is expensive... its not as sweet as sugar, but it costs as much as twenty times more per kilo.

##### Risks
There has been a study that it causes heart risk and cardiovascular failure. The study was connected with serum erythritol levels being high in patients who have had a cardiovascular episode during the research.
But erythritol is also produced by the body. Serum levels of erythritol vs dietary levels of erythritol, is the same as serum levels cholesterol vs dietary cholesterol. The correlation between the two is not as strong. Serum erythritol is also higher in patients with higher weight. 

**All this to say**, I can't tell you that its 10000% safe. But, the study is very weak. Here it is for reference.: [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02223-9.epdf?sharing_token=S6RhzXwq5vixDiTcaQrfbNRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0MTnVt_Yzm2YDkmKtSZJOysYZlROr0ymfAdj9yPHH8bMVWpKjhPzPeMT8zTG9DpNMmnfRfOqNqOH8PhwI2X9sxfHMa-Tpawl-dyIWq9WdTUO2lqDJWIHLoFK3aG5AGi1YgYwh45eJcIr6Ru_oHiYM6tWV1e8xmMJVCD16hz5Vdb-g%3D%3D&tracking_referrer=www.cnn.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02223-9.epdf?sharing_token=S6RhzXwq5vixDiTcaQrfbNRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0MTnVt_Yzm2YDkmKtSZJOysYZlROr0ymfAdj9yPHH8bMVWpKjhPzPeMT8zTG9DpNMmnfRfOqNqOH8PhwI2X9sxfHMa-Tpawl-dyIWq9WdTUO2lqDJWIHLoFK3aG5AGi1YgYwh45eJcIr6Ru_oHiYM6tWV1e8xmMJVCD16hz5Vdb-g%3D%3D&tracking_referrer=www.cnn.com)

##### My Current Conclusions
I need to try it.

### Allulose
Seems to be recommended as another great natural alternative as a sweetener

### Monk Fruit Sweetener
Mysterious...needs more research
